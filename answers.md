1. What is the DOM?
2. What is an event?
3. What is an event listener?
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
5. What is a component? 

1 -- The Document Object Model is a tree structure that houses all the html structures/elements as nodes, and allows them to be live-updated. 

2 -- An event is a function that is called in response to some user input/interaction in the DOM.

3 -- An event listener is a DOM method that monitors the window for things the user does (such as clicks, scrolls, and right-clicks), and then executes some function when it observes user-input. 

4 -- We would convert any array-like object into an actual array so that we could inheret from the prototype "Array". That allows us to gain access to all of Array's built-in methods.

5 -- A component is a block of code that can be repeated. It's more of a way of structuring code so that developers avoid repeating themselves.
